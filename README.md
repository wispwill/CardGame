# CardGame
Java 2 Final - Card game.

## Problems
This project was made in two hours, therefore any issues are unresolved.
A window pops up with several cards on it, face down. Player one clicks a card, and then player two clicks a card.
Each card flips up and whoever's card is a higher denomination wins. Wins are recorded in a text box on the window.
